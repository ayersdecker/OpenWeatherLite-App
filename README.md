# Open Weather Lite
Version 1.0 is available now!

> Purpose

This application was a test of both MAUI device controls alongside the openWeatherAPI. The project is meant to utilize tools studied during my NMAD 261 Course - RIT/NTID. Though not a large project like others in my collection. This application was my first attempt at using API in a mobile setting. Please keep in mind that updates are on its way! 

> Is it free?

Yes, feel free to download this application and try it out! It has been approved for Android (OS V.10+) and iOS, but has the ability to run via Windows, Tizen, MacOS, Android Wear, WatchOS, and Fuschia devices.

> Where can I send feedback?

Please send me an email about this project or others at dra2214@rit.edu or ayersdecker@gmail.com
